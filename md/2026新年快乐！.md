Subject: Question from a young free software enthusiast in China
From: chenwumm@qq.com
To: rms@gun.org

Hello Mr. Stallman,
 
My name is Chenwu (pen name), a middle school student from China, and I am a free software enthusiast.
I have read your GNU Manifesto and am currently learning the C programming language.
I love free software and I am very interested in software freedom.
 
I mainly use Vim to write code, and I plan to learn Emacs in the future.
My main operating system is Debian.
I strongly support software freedom and the ethics of free software.
 
I would like to ask: as a student like me, how can I participate in the GNU Project?
 
Thank you very much for all your work for software freedom.
 
Sincerely,
Chenwu
 
 

 (Chinese original)
你好，斯托曼先生：

我非常喜欢自由软件，对软件自由十分感兴趣。
 
我现在主要用Vim写代码，之后也想学习Emacs。
我主要使用的操作系统是Debian。
我非常支持软件自由和自由软件伦理。
 
请问像我这样的学生，可以如何参与GNU项目？
 
非常感谢您为软件自由所做的一切工作。

I am not on vacation, but I am at the end of a long time delay. I am
located somewhere on Earth, but as far as responding to email is concerned,
I appear to be at the edge of the solar system.

After your message arrives at gnu.org, I will collect it in my next batch of
incoming mail, some time within the following 24 hours. I will spend much of
the following day reading that batch of mail and will come across your
message at some point. If I write a response immediately, it will go out in
the next outgoing batch--typically around 24 hours after I collected your
message, but occasionally sooner or later than that. Please expect a minimum
delay of between 24 and 48 hours in receiving a response to your mail to me.

If your message is hard to understand or responding takes real work,
the response could take longer.

So please wait 48 hours after sending a message before you resend it,
remind me about it, or ask if I have received it. If it has been less
than 48 hours, the absence of a response from me only means you have not
given me time to answer.

If you are having a conversation with me, please keep in mind that each
message you receive from me is a response to the mail you sent 24 to 48 hours
earlier, and when writing it, I probably had not yet downloaded your later
mail.


If you do not wish to receive this message ever again, please send a message
to rms-autoreply-control@gnu.org with the subject "OFF".
Otherwise, you might receive a reply like this one up to once a month.

还有我在10号注册了Telehack，一个古早互联网模拟器。我还在上面交到了第一位外国朋友。他是来自越南胡志明市的beerdang。我才注册7天就已经玩到9级(DAEMON)了。你可以`finger chenwu@telehack.com`查看我的个人信息。目前我好像是整个服务器上最活跃的中国玩家。

突然想起我在暑假的时候还给林纳斯发过邮件，还发过两封，但是都没得到回复。
等我再找一下，明天会发一篇文章记录我给林纳斯发的两封邮件的原文。
