[HELP] SetX OS & Kernel Compilation Guidance from a Young Developer
Hi Linus,

I'm not sure why you haven't replied to my emails. Maybe you didn't see them?

I've made some improvements based on Alpine and named it "SetX" (basically just changed the system name, prettified the terminal, and added some packages. The name comes from the bash debug command `set +x`).

But now I want to compile the Linux kernel myself instead of modifying existing systems. Could you give me some guidance? (Note: I'm doing all this in Termux on my phone.)

Looking forward to your reply.

My first email:

Hello, Linus!

I am Chenwu TechnologyHobbyist From China.
I am a programming enthusiast passionate about technology and a 6th-grade elementary school student. I now want to research Linux kernel compilation.

I have already modified Alpine Linux myself to create a system (though it’s still essentially Alpine), but I also want to compile my own system from scratch. I’m using Termux on my phone to do this (actually, I have a computer at home, but it’s an ancient WinXP machine—very slow and can’t run virtual machine software).

Could you guide me? Or could you tell me how to do it?
I look forward to your reply!
