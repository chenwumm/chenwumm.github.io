<pre><code>Subject: Question from a young free software enthusiast in China
From: chenwumm@qq.com
To: rms@gun.org

Hello Mr. Stallman,
 
My name is Chenwu (pen name), a middle school student from China, and I am a free software enthusiast.
I have read your GNU Manifesto and am currently learning the C programming language.
I love free software and I am very interested in software freedom.
 
I mainly use Vim to write code, and I plan to learn Emacs in the future.
My main operating system is Debian.
I strongly support software freedom and the ethics of free software.
 
I would like to ask: as a student like me, how can I participate in the GNU Project?
 
Thank you very much for all your work for software freedom.
 
Sincerely,
Chenwu
 
 

 (Chinese original)
你好，斯托曼先生：
 
我叫晨雾（笔名），是一名来自中国的初中生，同时也是一名自由软件爱好者。
我阅读过您的《GNU宣言》，目前正在学习C语言。
我非常喜欢自由软件，对软件自由十分感兴趣。
 
我现在主要用Vim写代码，之后也想学习Emacs。
我主要使用的操作系统是Debian。
我非常支持软件自由和自由软件伦理。
 
请问像我这样的学生，可以如何参与GNU项目？
 
非常感谢您为软件自由所做的一切工作。
 
此致
晨雾</code></pre>

I am not on vacation, but I am at the end of a long time delay. I am
located somewhere on Earth, but as far as responding to email is concerned,
I appear to be at the edge of the solar system.

After your message arrives at gnu.org, I will collect it in my next batch of
incoming mail, some time within the following 24 hours. I will spend much of
the following day reading that batch of mail and will come across your
message at some point. If I write a response immediately, it will go out in
the next outgoing batch--typically around 24 hours after I collected your
message, but occasionally sooner or later than that. Please expect a minimum
delay of between 24 and 48 hours in receiving a response to your mail to me.

If your message is hard to understand or responding takes real work,
the response could take longer.

So please wait 48 hours after sending a message before you resend it,
remind me about it, or ask if I have received it. If it has been less
than 48 hours, the absence of a response from me only means you have not
given me time to answer.

If you are having a conversation with me, please keep in mind that each
message you receive from me is a response to the mail you sent 24 to 48 hours
earlier, and when writing it, I probably had not yet downloaded your later
mail.


If you do not wish to receive this message ever again, please send a message
to rms-autoreply-control@gnu.org with the subject &quot;OFF&quot;.
Otherwise, you might receive a reply like this one up to once a month.</code></pre>
<p>还有我在10号注册了Telehack，一个古早互联网模拟器。我还在上面交到了第一位外国朋友。他是来自越南胡志明市的beerdang。我才注册7天就已经玩到9级(DAEMON)了。你可以<code>finger chenwu@telehack.com</code>查看我的个人信息。目前我好像是整个服务器上最活跃的中国玩家。</p>
<p>突然想起我在暑假的时候还给林纳斯发过邮件，还发过两封，但是都没得到回复。
等我再找一下，明天会发一篇文章记录我给林纳斯发的两封邮件的原文。</p></pre>
