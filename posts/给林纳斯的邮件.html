$ cat linus.txt [HELP] SetX OS &amp; Kernel Compilation Guidance from a
Young Developer Hi Linus,</p>
<p>I’m not sure why you haven’t replied to my emails. Maybe you didn’t
see them?</p>
<p>I’ve made some improvements based on Alpine and named it “SetX”
(basically just changed the system name, prettified the terminal, and
added some packages. The name comes from the bash debug command
<code>set +x</code>).</p>
<p>But now I want to compile the Linux kernel myself instead of
modifying existing systems. Could you give me some guidance? (Note: I’m
doing all this in Termux on my phone.)</p>
<p>My blog: https://chenwumm.github.io/</p>
<p>Looking forward to your reply.</p>
<p>Chenwu Teho from China</p>
<p>My first email:</p>
<p>Hello, Linus!</p>
<p>I am Chenwu TechnologyHobbyist From China. I am a programming
enthusiast passionate about technology and a 6th-grade elementary school
student. I now want to research Linux kernel compilation.</p>
<p>I have already modified Alpine Linux myself to create a system
(though it’s still essentially Alpine), but I also want to compile my
own system from scratch. I’m using Termux on my phone to do this
(actually, I have a computer at home, but it’s an ancient WinXP
machine—very slow and can’t run virtual machine software).</p>
<p>Could you guide me? Or could you tell me how to do it? I look forward
to your reply!</p>
